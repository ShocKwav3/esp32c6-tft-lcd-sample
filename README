## Introduction
This project aims to provide a simple and effective way to control a LCD display using an ESP32C6 microcontroller. It includes sample code and instructions to get started quickly. I used a Waveshare ESP32C6 board with integreated 1.47inch display.

## Features
- Interface with LCD display
- Display text and graphics
- Easy-to-use API

## Hardware Requirements
- ESP32C6 microcontroller
- LCD display

## Software Requirements
- PlatformIO IDE
- Arduino core 3.0.x for ESP32C6
    - Arduino is officially not available through platformio. I used a community branch which allows developent for such case. Check `platform` in `platformio.ini`.
- `tft_eSPI` library
    - Due to the lack of support of ESP32C6, at this time, I used [Cincinnatu](https://github.com/Cincinnatu)'s branch which has a [PR](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI/pull/3399) to the library, based on [this issue](https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI/issues/3255), but not yet merged.
    - It can be found in the `lib` directory.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in PlatformIO IDE
3. Install the required libraries
4. Compile

## Usage
1. **Connect the hardware:**
    - Connect the ESP32C6 to the LCD display via SPI according to pinout diagram.
2. **Update config:**
    - Open `config/tft_config.h` and make changes according to connection made previous step.
2. **Upload the code:**
    - Upload the code to the ESP32C6 using PlatformIO.
3. **Run the project:**
    - Power on the board and the LCD and test should show up on the display.
